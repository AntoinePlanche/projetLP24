## non-graphic key


keyone = Player, choose the start configuration.
keytwo = How many line should the grid have ?
keythree = How many column should the grid have ?
keyfour = Type the line of the new black cell of the start configuration.
keyfive = This line is not included in this grid.\nRetry.
keysix = Type the column of the new black cell of the start configuration.
keyseven = This column is not included in this grid.\nRetry.
keyeight = cell already black, retry please.
keynine = Type 1 to add a new black cell on the start configuration or 0 to quit.
keyten = Retry.\nType 1 to add a new black cell on the start configuration or 0 to quit.
keyeleven = Master game, choose the configuration to achieve.\nThe more complex the configuration to achieve is, the more points the player earns in the event of victory.
keytwelve = Type the line of the new black cell of the configuration to achieve.
keythirteen = Type the column of the new black cell of the configuration to achieve.
keyfourteen = Type 1 to add a new black cell on the configuration to achieve or 0 to quit.
keyfifteen = Retry.\nType 1 to add a new black cell on the configuration to achieve or 0 to quit.
keysixteen = What is the lap limit imposed to reach the desired configuration ?
keyseventeen = The number of maximum lap must be greater than 0.
keyeighteen = the number of line must be greater than 1.
keynineteen = the number of column must be greater than 1.
keytwenty = \nWe are on lap 
keytwentyone = Type on 1 to go to the next lap, 0 to quit the simulation.
keytwentytwo = Retry.\nType on 1 to go to the next lap, 0 to quit the simulation.
keytwentythree = Oh no, you lost !!
keytwentyfour = Congratulation, you won in :
keytwentyfive = \ laps !!
keytwentysix = Congratulation, your score for this victory is :
keytwentyseven = Too bad, you lost, don't hesitate to try again !!\n
keytwentyeight = End of the simulation !!
keytwentynine = What level of difficulty do you choose ?\nType 1 to have the right to change a cell from black to white or from white to black from the second round of the simulation.\nType 2 to not have this right.
keythirty = Retry please.
keythirtyone = Do you want to change the color of a cell ?\nIf the designated cell is white then it will turn black and vice versa.\nType 1 for yes or 0 for no.
keythirtytwo = What is the line of the cell whose color you want to change ?
keythirtythree = What is the column of the cell whose color you want to change ?
keythirtyfour = Do you want to play an interactive mini-game or just leave the simulation turned from a starting configuration ?\nType 1 for the mini-game or 2 for the simulation.
keythirtyfive = Type on the keyboard to stop the simulation.
keythirtysix = Choose the start configuration.
keythirtyseven = There are 
keythirtyeight = black cell(s).\n


## graphic key


keygraphicone = STOP
keygraphictwo = START
keygraphicthree = Choose the initial configuration by clicking on the cells.
keygraphicfour = You leave the simulation.
keygraphicfive = Too Bad
keygraphicsix = Resume
keygraphicseven = Number of black cells : 
keygraphiceight = Lap : 
keygraphicnine = How many seconds should there be between each round? (Decimal possible)
keygraphicten = time
keygraphiceleven = Congratulation


## graphic mini game key


keygraphicminigameone = Next lap
keygraphicminigamethree = Change a cell
keygraphicminigamefour = toward the player's initial configuration
keygraphicminigamesix = click on the cells to choose the configuration to reach
keygraphicminigameseven = How many laps do you allow the player to reach the requested configuration ?
keygraphicminigameeight = Number of laps limits
keygraphicminigamenine = The number of laps must be greater than 1, try again
keygraphicminigameeleven = Player choose the starting configuration to reach the configuration chosen by the game master.\nThe verification is done from round 1 so it does not work to put the same directly.
keygraphicminigametwelve = Two difficulty levels are available.\nAn easy level where you can change the color of a cell per lap.\nA difficult level where you cannot do that.
keygraphicminigamethirteen = Difficulty level
keygraphicminigamefourteen = Easy
keygraphicminigamefifteen = Hard
keygraphicminigamesixteen = What level of difficulty do you want?


## configuration key


keyconfigurationone = console
keyconfigurationtwo = graphic interface
keyconfigurationthree = What type of graph do you want?
keyconfigurationfour = Choice of the graphic style
keyconfigurationfive = mini game
keyconfigurationsix = What kind of games would you like to play?
keyconfigurationseven = type of games
keyconfigurationeight = How many lines are there in the grid?
keyconfigurationnine = Number of lines
keyconfigurationten = The number of lines must be greater than 1.
keyconfigurationeleven = Warning
keyconfigurationtwelve = How many columns are there in the grid?
keyconfigurationthirteen = Number of columns
keyconfigurationfourteen = The number of columns must be greater than 1.
keyconfigurationfifteen = Game master, choose the configuration to reach for the player.
keyconfigurationsixteen = Game master
